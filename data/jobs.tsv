The government will also allow the unemployed and some workers and sole traders adversely affected by COVID-19 to access up to $10,000 of their superannuation in 2019-20 and a further $10,000 in 2020-21. Minimum superannuation drawdown requirements have also been reduced and social security deeming rates (the rate of income beneficiaries are assumed to be earning from financial investments) have also been reduced.  	0.1	A$2bn	On 7 April, the government introduced a mandatory code of conduct in relation to commercial tenancies. The Code imposes a set of good faith leasing principles for application to commercial tenancies (including retail, office and industrial) in circumstances where the tenant has annual turnover up to A$50 million and is eligible for the government's JobKeeper programme. The Code includes rent reductions that are proportional to the tenant's decline in turnover, in order to ensure that the burden is shared between landlords and tenants. On 9 April, Commonwealth and State governments agreed to a nationally consistent approach to hardship support across the essential services for households and small businesses. The principles for dealing with entities in financial stress are i) offering flexible payment options to all households and small businesses in financial stress; ii) Not disconnecting restricting supply/services to those in financial stress; iii) Deferring debt recovery proceedings and credit default listing; iv) Waiving late fees and interest charges on debt; and v) minimising planned outages for critical works, and provide as much notice as possible to assist households and businesses during any outage.	--		Information not available	Information not available

Around 66,000 care-takers work in the labour-intensive 24h care. Austrians constitute only 1.6% of 24h care-takers. Around 50% of these care-takers come from Romania who currently cannot cross the Hungarian border and a further 30% from the Slovak Republic. Slovaks, the second largest group among care-takers, are only allowed to enter if their place of work is not more than 30km from the border. Though the Austrian government is in negotiations with its neighbours no solution has been reached so far. <Br/><Br/>For the moment, the government has introduced two immediate measures for the 460.000 persons in need of care. Firstly, the government is seeking former Civilian Servants who completed their service within the last five years to step in. While this pool amounts to around 45,000 persons, the government estimates that about 14.600 additional Civilian Servants can be mobilized this way. Secondly, federal provinces are setting up additional capacities for mobile and stationary care, financed through a EUR 100 million fund from the federal government. Another 60 million are granted to the health system and EUR 130 million are given to hospitals for equipment and to finance over-time payments. Lower Austria flied in 231 care-takes directly from Bulgaria and Romania. <Br/><Br/>From April 1 on, the government has introduced further measures to contain the propagation of the virus. Wearing masks is now mandatory in open spaces, including supermarkets. Vulnerable people have to work from home. <Br/><Br/>The government has started testing representative samples of Austrians for infection with Covid-19. A first test with 2,197 Austrians suggested a rather low rate of infection (around 1% of total population). Further testing with larger samples are planned in the near future.<Br/>	--		* All workers (private and public sector) can be requested to use all remaining leave days from last year and to deplete any over-time hours.  <Br/><Br/>* Short-time working (EUR 5 billion): The Public Employment Service Austria (AMS) takes over the salary of all workers (except public service) including apprentices of min. 10% up to 90% of the working time according to collective bargaining agreements up to a certain threshold (100% for apprentices). This threshold depends on gross salary and is 90% for salaries below EUR 1,700, 85% for salaries below EUR 2,685 and 80% for salaries below EUR 5,370; apprentices will be compensated in full. Any application to the short-time working scheme will be handled within 48h.

Member States will not have to pay back to the EU budget unspent pre-financing received from structural funds (about EUR 8 billion). Instead, they will be able to use it as national co-financing for the next tranches of their structural fund allocations (about EUR 29 billion). Investment for fostering the crisis response capacities in public health services and some financing of working capital in SMEs will become eligible.<Br/><Br/>* The Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+), proposed on 2 April, complements the CRII by further enhancing flexibility in the use of cohesion funds. This enhanced flexibility is inter alia provided through transfer possibilities across the three cohesion policy funds (the European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund and Cohesion Fund), transfers between the different categories of regions (e.g. less vs more developed), flexibility regarding thematic concentration, the possibility for a 100% EU co-financing rate for the accounting year 2020-2021, and simplified procedural steps.<Br/><Br/>* Maximum flexibility will be deployed in the application of the Stability and Growth Pact by activating for the first time (on 23 March) the general escape clause in case of a severe economic downturn for the euro area or EU as a whole.<Br/><Br/>* The scope of the EU Solidarity Fund has been extended to cover major public health emergencies and possible advance payments from this Fund have been increased (proposal on 13 March, in force since 1 April).

EUR 100 billion (0.7% of 2019 EU27 GDP) will be available for this instrument (with no pre-allocated national envelopes), backed by EUR 25 billion of guarantees voluntarily committed by Member States to the EU budget. SURE will have a temporary nature: its duration and scope are limited to tackling the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.

In addition, the ECB has introduced supervisory flexibility regarding the treatment of non-performing loans (NPLs), in particular to allow banks to fully benefit from public guarantees and moratoriums. Flexibility will also extend to banks' implementation of NPL reduction strategies (20 March). Furthermore, the ECB has asked banks not to pay dividends until at least 1 October 2020 (27 March).<Br/>	Information not available	--		Information not available	--		Information not available	Information not available
