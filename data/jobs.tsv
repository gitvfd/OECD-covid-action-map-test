On 31 March, the authorities closed hotels, temporary accommodation services, hairdressers, public parks and churches. Compulsory face covering in public from 16 April.	Teleworking encouraged when possible	Payouts to parents who have to stay at home with children. If both parents of the child work, one parent may apply for additional childcare allowance. They can also share childcare within the 14-day limit. Additional care allowance is granted to parents for a total of 14 days, regardless of the number of children needing care. Carer's allowance and additional care allowance are granted from the Social Insurance Fund. This means that benefits are not charged to the employers' fund. Even if the employer pays the benefit (if required to do so), the amounts paid are settled by ZUS. 	Sick leave is granted for the periods of quarantine if indivdually ordered by the authorities. Benefits for child care are granted in the case of children being under quarantine. These do not apply to people self-guarantining. Allowance of 50% of the minimum wage to farmers and their household members in case they are subject to quarantine or hospitalisation		One-off (extended in April to up to three monthly) cash payment(s) up to PLN2080 (80% of minimum wage) for the self-employed and workers employed under civil law contracts. If economic activity is stopped due to coronavirus a self-employed receives sick-leave benefit. Self-employed persons and micro-firms which experience at least 50-percent drop in revenues since February will also be eligible for exemption from payment of social security contributions for three months. This initial measure has been extended for two possible additional months. Self-employed (up to 80% of the minimum wage) and employees under civil law contracts are eligible.	Short-term work schemes (for employees) will cover 40% of pay (up to the level of the national average wage in 2019) for workers of firms experiencing a monthly fall in their revenues of at least 25%. Employers will cover an additional 40%, while the worker will have to bear the remaining loss. In addition, one-off monthly benefit will be paid by the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) to self-employed (up to 80% of the minimum wage) and employees under civil law contracts, for a gross amount of about PLN 2,000 (EUR 465). The expected costs of these measures are around 1.3% of 2019 GDP.  State-support for the protection of jobs extended to NGOs, non-profit and public benefit organisations. On 8 April, the government launched a PLN 100 billion (around EUR 22 billion or 4.5% of GDP) financial lifeline to companies, to reduce incentives to lay-off workers in the current downturn. The scheme will consist of 3-year zero-interest loans to struggling SMEs (50% of the envelope), micro-enterprises (25%) and large companies (25%). About 60% of total loans could be disbursed in the form of grants (up to 75% for SMEs and micro-enterprises), provided recipients will keep their employees during the loan period.	Financing and guarantee measures for firms (for around 3% of 2019 GDP): loan guarantees; operational leasing schemes (for firms in the transport sector); and PLN 5,000 (about EUR 1,200) micro loans for firms with less than 9 employees, non-refundable in case they do not dismiss employees within 6 months.

Parents, employed as dependent employees, who need to stay home to take care of their kids (up to 12 years old) after school closures, and who cannot telework, have their leave from work “justified”, i.e. they cannot be laid-off for unjustified leave. In addition, in order to help their employers cope with their leave, they will only receive 2/3 of their salary during that period. These 2/3 of salary will be paid half-half by the employer and the Social Security.	Workers who present a medical certificate justifying their 14 days quarantine are fully taken in charge by social security as if on a sick leave, i.e. companies are not paying the salary, the social security is. Social security pays starting from Day 1 of the quarantine, unlike for the sick leave where there is a waiting period of 3 to 10 days usually.	Parents who are self-employed or independent workers and can no longer work to take care of their kids (up to 12 again) because of school closure, receive 1/3 of their average wage paid by Social Security.	€438 for 6 months to self-employed workers.

Firms pay 30% of that sum, social security pays the remaining 70%. This can last up to 6 months maximum. - With training: If firms wish so, instead of temporarily sending workers home and paying the 30% mentioned above, they can take advantage of the current period of reduced activity to reskill or upskill their employees. In this case, the IEFP (the national public institute for professional qualification) will pay 50% of the gross income of their employees up to the RMMG (the national Minimum Guaranteed Monthly Income, which is 635€ per month from the 1st Jan 2020 - see link above). The firm will still have to pay the remaining 50%. This is a more advantageous training support scheme than usually. 	On a case-by-case basis, deferral of social security contributions and taxes, guaranteed treasury loans of 200 million Euros for SMEs. On March 18th, the government announced a 9.2 billion-euro package out of which 5.2 billion are fiscal measures such as flexible payment schedules for tax payment, 3 billion are state-backed credit guarantees and 1 billion related to social security payments stimulus to support workers and provide liquidity for companies affected by the coronavirus outbreak. While no information so far is provided on the impact of the stimulus on the draft budget, it is estimated that the total package represents 17.3% of quarterly GDP.

On March the 29th the confinement’s scope was enlarged including now all non-essential economic activities. 	Companies should encourage the implementation of teleworking whenever the activity of the company allows it. To this end, ongoing public programmes have been expedited to support the digitisation of small and medium-sized enterprises. For those sectors still working, the health and safety responsible authorities (Instituto Nacional de Seguridad y Salud en el Trabajo) has published updated guidelines on specifics orientations and the use of individual protection equipment.	Periods of isolation or contagion of workers as a consequence of the COVID-19 virus will be considered as a situation assimilated to a work accident. This enables workers and self-employed subject to isolation measures to perceive the economic benefit of temporary disability of the Social Security system during the period of isolation, which is 75% of their social security regulatory base (compared to 60% for workers on sick leave with a common illness) and to do so from the first day of leave.

This enables workers and self-employed to perceive the economic benefit of temporary disability of the Social Security system during the period of illness or isolation: 75% of the social security regulatory base (compared to 60% for workers on sick leave with a common illness). This measure has been extended to workers framed in Special Regimes of the Public Sector. Following the suspension of all non-essential economic activities adopted on March 29, a paid leave was granted between 30 March and 9 April for workers of non-essential activities that cannot be carried out by teleworking. The non-worked days will be compensated with extra working time before 31 December under the terms agreed in collective agreements.	Teleworking and flexible work hours to adjust for child care needs.

Workers affected by school closures and/or that need to provide care for dependents are entitled to adapt their working hours as needed. These includes stopping working if necessary.  Health activities and care institutions for elderly and dependent care have been declared an essential service. Therefore, these institutions must maintain their activity during the health crisis, whether they are public or private. Health and care centres and  institutions are not allowed to apply suspensions or reduction hours.	Automatic prorogation of unemployment benefits during the health crisis. Suspension of rules concerning minimum contribution periods for unemployment benefits during the crisis, including for temporary workers. Six month moratorium on taxes for self-employed.  Extraordinary allowance for self-employed workers, affected by the suspension of economic activity.

A three-month credit moratorium on the payment of credits and non-mortgage loans by vulnerable groups. A temporary extraordinary unemployment benefit has been established for domestic employees in the event of lack of activity, reduction of hors worked or termination of the contract. The amount of the subsidy will be 70% of the Social Security "regulatory base" with a max. of 950 euros.  An exceptional subsidy is introduced for workers with a temporary contract of at least two months, when their work contract expires and they do not have the minimum period required to access ordinary unemployment benefits. This allowance, of 430 euros, will last for one month and can be extended.                                                                      Contracts for temporary teaching staff at university that are due to end during the State of Alarm are extended, as well as research contracts financed by grants of the National System of Science, Technology and Innovation. These extensions will be equivalent to the duration of the State of Alarm and, exceptionally may be can be extended up to 3 months after the end of the State of Alarm. During the State of Alarm and until June 30th, it is possible to combine unemployment benefits with temporary employment in agriculture. This measure applies to unemployed people, workers under a temporary suspension of contract, migrant workers whose work permit ends between June 15th and June 30th of 2020, and young people (between 18 and 21 years old) non-Spanish citizens legal residents in Spain.     	Relaxing the rules for ERTEs (a STW) allowing for temporary suspension or reduction of hours (duration of procedures reduced from 15 to 7 days). It implies an exemption for companies' social security contributions. Extension of social security bonuses in discontinuous fixed contracts to cover contracts from February to June 2020 in the tourism sector, in order to preserve employment. The process to apply for the temporary employment adjustments is simplified for firms and workers and the unemployment benefits are paid from the date of suspension; all temporary employment adjustments process related to the Covid-19 crisis are covered under this provision, even if they were initiated before the approval of the measure.   	Six month moratorium on taxes for SMEs. Companies that have received loans from the General Secretariat for Industry and Small and Medium Enterprises are allowed to postpone their repayment.  The government announced the mobilisation of 200 billion euros (20% of GDP), of which 117 billion will be public (100 billion for guarantees and 17 billion to help those affected by the crisis) and the rest will be based on private sources. Moreover a 2 billion euros specific line of guarantees will be allocated for export companies. A specific financing line is available through the Official Credit Institute for the amount of 400 million euros to meet the liquidity needs of companies and self-employed workers in the tourism sector, as well as related activities that are being affected by the current situation. Extension of the moratorium on mortgage payments (announced on March 17 for vulnerable groups) to offices/commercial premises of the self-employed impacted by the crisis, and from 1 month to 3 months. Suspension of interest and loan payments for entrepreneurs in the tourism industry for one year. Affected SMEs will be granted deferrals of their tax debts with the Administration during a six month period, without interest. This will allow 14 billion euros of liquidity to be injected into the economic system. Additionally, the Government has deferred the tax-payment for SMES and self-employed with a maximum of 600,000 euros turnover, from April 20th until May 20th. 	Economic dismissals related to Covid-19 are not allowed. Companies have to use ERTEs (see column I).

SWE		April 14, 2020		65.903	18.572	Sweden	Secondary schools and universities closed		Central government assumes the entire cost of all sick pay during April and May. 			Temporary reinforcement of unemployment insurance: the funds for the Employment Service to manage newly registered unemployed and notice have been increased as well as those for the unemployment insurance funds to manage notices; the membership terms for joining an unemployment insurance fund have been shortened from 12 to 3 months; the ceiling in the unemployment insurance fund is raised temporarily from SEK 910 to SEK 1 200 per day for the first 100 compensation days; the ceiling for basic insurance is temporarily raised from SEK 365 to SEK 510 per day; the waiting period of 6 days before receiving unemployment benefits has been abolished. The period during which a person may have a subsidised job (extra job, new start job or introductory job) will be extended by an additional year for those who already have such jobs; the maximum time for support for starting a business will be extended from six to twelve months; municipalities will receive grants for more summer jobs for young people and funding for green jobs. More opportunities will be opened for vocational education and training throughout the country. Self-employed persons will be entitled to receive standardised sick pay for 14 days. Self-employed will received a reduction of individual contributions as that proposed for firms (see right). Self-employed will also be able to defer their VAT payments that otherwise should be paid during the spring, such as on 12 May.   	Employers’ wage costs can be halved and the central government will cover a larger share of the costs. This model is similar to short-time work, but the subsidy level is significantly increased. Morevoer, from 1 May 2020 and for three months, employers will be able to reduce their employees’ working hours by up to 80% (instead of 60%) and the government will bear most of the cost. The wage costs will be reduced by over 70% (previously 50%), while workers will retain almost 90% of their original wage. Combined with the reduced employers’ social security contributions, employer costs can be reduced by up to 86% per cent during May and June. Control mechanisms will be enhanced. Wage negotiations have been postponed to the Autumn.	A central government loan guarantee has been proposed to make it easier for companies to access financing. The proposal means that the central government will guarantee 70 per cent of new loans banks provide to companies that are experiencing financial difficulty due to the COVID-19 virus but that are otherwise robust. The Swedish Export Credit Agency's loan limit is extended to SEK 200bn (about EUR 18bn, 3.8% of GDP) from SEK 125bn. The ceiling for credit guarantees from the agency which insures export companies and banks against the risk of non-payment in export transactions (EKN) is increased to SEK 500bn (about EUR 45bn, 9.6% of GDP) from SEK 450bn, the same amount as during the 2008 financial crisis.  A temporary reduction of employers’ social security contributions will be proposed for the period 1 March to 30 June 2020 so that only the old age pension contribution is paid (up to 30 employees and on that portion of the employee’s wage that does not exceed SEK 25 000 per month). Support to facilitate and speed up renegotiation of rents.			https://www.government.se/government-policy/the-governments-work-in-response-to-the-virus-responsible-for-covid-19/ https://www.fi.se/en/published/press-releases/2020/loss-of-income-due-to-corona-virus-disease-a-cause-for-exemption-from-amortisation/
CHE		April 2, 2020		47.012	8.351	Switzerland	Gatherings in public spaces of more than five people are prohibited until 19/4/2020. If five or fewer people meet, they must maintain a distance of two metres from one another. All establishments open to the public will be closed, except establishments such as food stores and other shops selling articles for everyday use (e.g. kiosks and petrol station shops), takeaway establishments, staff canteens, meal delivery services, pharmacies or banks. Classroom teaching is banned until 19 April 2020. Entry restrictions for all persons (except from Liechtenstein). Exceptions are possible, for example for people who live or work in Switzerland. Anyone wishing to enter Switzerland despite the entry ban must prove that one of the exceptional conditions is met. This arrangement will apply for a maximum of 6 months.	Hygiene regulations for companies, recommendations for home office. Employers in construction and industry are obliged to comply with the recommendations of the Federal Office of Public Health regarding hygiene and social distance. For this purpose, the number of persons present on construction sites or in companies must be limited accordingly. People at high risk should work from home. If that is not possible, they are to be placed on leave by their employers, but will continue to be paid by their employer.			Parents with children under 12 years of age who have to interrupt their employment because third-party care for the children is no longer guaranteed are entitled to compensation. This applies both to employees and self-employed workers.	Unemployed persons are covered by compulsory unemployment insurance. The submission of proof of work efforts is waived. All persons entitled to benefits receive a maximum of 120 additional daily allowances.   Self-employed persons are not entitled to short-time work compensation. However, if they suffer a loss of income due to the closure of a business or the ban on events ordered under federal law, they are entitled to compensation amounting to 80 percent of their income and a maximum of 196 Swiss francs per day. Further measures for persons in the cultural sector (hardship payments).	The administrative procedures to apply for short-time work (part-time unemployment benefit) have been eased at short notice: i) the waiting period to benefit from this indemnity is eliminated until September 30, 2020 (against 2 days previously, the first days being borne by the company); ii) Employees no longer have to reduce their overtime before they can benefit from short-time compensation. iii)The approval period for short-time work is extended from 3 to 6 months. This will allow the number of applications to be minimised and thus speed up the approval procedure. In addition, urgent simplifications have been made in the area of processing applications and payments for short-time work with the adoption of new provisions. Short-time work compensation can now also be paid to employees on fixed-term contracts and to persons working for a temporary work organisation. Furthermore, short-time work compensation is accessible for employer-like employees (for example, shareholders of a limited liability company who work as salaried employees in the company), persons who work in the business of the spouse or registered partner as well as apprenticees, too.	CHF20 billion for a liquidity aid. Affected companies can apply to their banks for bridging credit facilities representing a maximum of 10% of their annual turnover and no more than CHF 20 million. Credits of up to CHF 500,000 will be fully secured by the Confederation, and will be paid out quickly and with the minimum of bureaucracy. Zero interest will be charged. Bridging credits that exceed CHF 500,000 will be secured by the Confederation to 85% of their value; the lending bank will secure the remaining 15%. Each company can obtain a credit of this type for up to CHF 20 million, which means a more rigorous bank review will be required. The interest rate on these credits is currently 0.5% on the loan secured by the Confederation. Further liquidity measures: Businesses should have the possibility to extend payment deadlines without having to pay default interest. For this reason, the interest rate for VAT, customs duties, special excise taxes and incentive taxes will be reduced to 0.0 percent in the period from 21 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. No interest will be charged during this period. Social insurance contributions: Companies affected by the crisis may be granted a temporary, interest-free deferral of payment of social security contributions. Companies also have the option of having the amount of the regular contributions adjusted if the sum of their wages has fallen significantly. The same applies to self-employed persons whose turnover has collapsed.   			https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/haeufig-gestellte-fragen.html

USA		April 10, 2020		40.731	-99.225	United States	Social distancing measures encouraged, large gathering are discouraged	Encourage employees to work from home and flex-hours if possible	Federal law generally does not require employers to provide paid leave to employees who are absent from work because they are sick (under the pre-existing Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) eligible employees of covered employers can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave), but the new "Families First Coronavirus Response Act" provides for 2 weeks of paid sick leave to workers in firms with more than 50 and less than 500 employees.		There is no federal law covering non-government employees who take off from work to care for healthy children, and employers are not required by federal law to provide leave to employees caring for dependents who have been dismissed from school or child care. However, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act introduces additional paid sick leave for workers with children for up to 3 months. If an employee is covered and eligible under the FMLA and is needed to care for a spouse, daughter, son, or parent who has a serious health condition, then the employee is entitled to up to 12 weeks of job-protected, unpaid leave during any 12-month period. Some States may have similar family leave laws. In those situations, covered employers must comply with the federal or state provision that provides the greater benefit to their employees.	Additional resources have been devoted to providing food for households with low income. Money was also targeted to support the expected increase of unemployment insurance, which is administered by the states. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act also increases Medicaid payments to states.  Unemployment insurance payments increased to $600 per week as well as a direct payment of $1200 for each adult and $500 for children for all US residents with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 ($150,000 married). The extra $600 payment will last for up to four months. Self-employed people will be newly eligible for unemployment benefits.

For the rest, they will pay 50% if states decide to add a new STC programs. 	The Small Business Administration has been instructed to use emergency power to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by coronavirus. The Treasury will defer tax payments without interest or penalties with the aim of shoring up liquidity. The Administration are requesting Congress to provide payroll tax relief.

This is a loan over 36 months, with a grace period of 6 months, and a nominal interest rate below current inflation.
