Young men who completed their mandatory year of "civil service", which can be chosen as an alternative to mandatory military service, within the last five years are mobilised to support long-term care and for essntial public services. Civil servants frequently take on roles as paramedics and in social care. While this pool amounts to around 45,000 persons, the government estimates that about 14.600 additional servants can be mobilisd this way. Long-term care relies heavily on staff from Eastern European countries, including Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia. Some regional governments have announced special flights to bring workers to Austria despite border closures and bonus payments to foreign long-term care staff who remain in Austria.  Federal provinces are setting up additional capacities for hospital inpatient and mobile care, financed through a EUR 100 million fund from the federal government. Another 60 million are granted to the health system and EUR 130 million are given to hospitals for equipment and to finance over-time payments.  Some regional governments, for example, have established care capcity in public facilities such as convention centers. These will provide care for milder cases when hospital capacity limits are reached.<br>From beginning of May, the federal railways will operate special non-stop trains beween Austria and Romania to transport long-term care personnel between their home country and their patients in Austria. These trains will form a 'corridor' through Hungary despite border closures.		On April 16, the Minister of Health announced a plan to test all patients and personnel in retirement and nursing homes. As part of easing of general restrictions, priority risk groups in the population have been defined, i.e. groups of people for whom an infection with Sars-Cov-2 could be particularly dangerous, was presented. These are elderly people and people with specified chronic illnesses, including HIV/AIDS, diabetes, or a severe cardiovascular or lung disease. Below who are not part of the elderly group but have a chronic disease are identified using data on prescription medicines, notified and a physician is asked to assess and confirm individual risk in each specific case. If risk is confirmed, a medical certificatie is provided, entitling the person to special protective measures at work, including prolonged telework, changes to the physical workspace or, if neither of the two is possible, special leave from work and financial support to employers. These rules will apply from early May.

The Czech Republic will launch a new “smart quarantine system” to track the movements of infected citizens. The monitoring system, which requires consent, will use data from mobile phones and payment cards of people who have been tested positive to find all the potential people that could be infected as a result. Tracked citizens will have to give their consent to the monitoring and the system will be tested during the second week of April.	https://www.vlada.cz/en/media-centrum/aktualne/measures-adopted-by-the-czech-government-against-coronavirus-180545/	All healthcare costs regarding testing, treatment, transport etc. of COVID-19 patients are paid from the statutory health insurance. Tests for COVID-19 are covered by SHI only if recommended by a physician (general practitioners, paediatricians, pneumologists, attending physicians in hospitals) or by the public health authority. 		Czech Technical University has developed a special model of respirator that can be produced by 3D printers. Printed respirators are at the same level of protection as highly demanded FFP3 face masks. Carmaker brand Škoda Auto produces the respirators in cooperation with the University and according to Škoda, they are able to make 60 respirators per day. <br>Following disease outbreak, the Ministry of Health banned the export of FFP3 respirators and started their price regulation. MoH also banned export of disinfectants for hand washing - this has been later released.  Stricter prescription regulation has been issued to safeguard Plaquenil stocks. Licensing of new medical devices and aids (associated with treating Covid-19 infection), including their development, approval and permission to produce, have been speeded-up. This includes approval of newly developed respirators and ventilators, as well as permission to produce disinfection solution for distilleries, universities and other producers. Fast-track approval by the State Institute of Drug Control also concerned Remdesivir, which allowed its administration in the Czechia. 	With the aim to boost health system capacity a bill was proposed (April 6, pending parliamentary approval), so that non-EU medical staff without fully validated degrees will be allowed to work in Czech hospitals for the time of the crisis and immediately after.	Drive-through testing have been implemented in Czechia.	only elderly are allowed to go to food stores and pharmacies during 10-12	
Denmark	DNK				56.113	9.096	The Novo Nordisk Foundation allocated €2.7 million to support research and development that can help Denmark to strengthen its preparedness for, and response to, future new viral epidemics, noting the outbreak of the COVID-19 is not an isolated event. The money will fund interdisciplinary research including surveillance and early detection of viral infections; developing new technologies for preventing or controlling epidemics; and optimising national preparedness to manage new viral diseases, including developing policies and procedures for rapidly testing and approving new treatments, technologies and vaccines.<br>The Governmnet has made DKK 150 million (around EUR 20 million) available for applications from public and private research institutions for health research specifically related to COVID-19 (announced 16 March, increased 30 March). 		Danish company (Blue Ocean Robotics) is selling a self-driving robot platform that is equipped with a UV light system.	Section on digital: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/danish-disinfection-robots-save-lives-fight-against-corona-virus  R&D Funding: https://sciencebusiness.net/news/canada-pledges-c275m-coronavirus-rd-adding-global-funding-rush			For potential situations with limited availability of tests, the Ministry of Health issued rules for prioritisation of testing. The below groups are going to be prioritised in the following order: hospitalised patients; people (working/living) in nursing homes and other closed institutions (if an outbreak is suspected); vulnerable groups, including frail elderly, people aged 80 or older, patients with mental health problems, an people with disabilities (even if COVID-19 is not suspected); all workers in critical services. As of <br>Danish Medicines Agency launched a national challenge “Denmark helps Denmark”, within which any private or public organisation can pitch solutions to the problem of shortages of COVID-19 tests or items such as protective gear for health workers, etc. The Agency also works with the regional authorities on options for rapid expansion of national production of any missing equipment. 	Regional authorities organised intensive up-skilling activities for various groups of health workers, such as anaesthesiology nurses and other intensive-care nurses, so they can take up more advanced tasks within ICUs. Extra training has been also devised and lunched for medical students, so they can start handling use of ventilators in ICUs. General nursing personnel is receiving up-skilling to take over tasks from, for example, nurses directed to care of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the Ministry of Health passed law, which allows, if needed, to expand capacity within the ambulance & emergency personnel, by adding categories of health workers that normally do not belong to the ambulance & emergency care workers.	The Ministry of Health created a dedicated COVID-19 Intensive Task Force (including representatives of the regional authorities as well as hospitals' managers and personnel) that monitors available intensive-care capacity and co-ordinates the adjustments across the country. The aim is to allow for flexible adjustments in local capacity as needs evolve by, for exmaple, rapid re-location of equipment and personnel. In all public hospitals, the services that require use of anastesiology and respiratory equipment have been reduced to the necessary minmum to create as much stand-by capacity as possible. The Ministry also requested that private hospitals make their equipment and personnel available to the public helath sector - the work on the legal provisions supporting this initiative has been commenced and is expected to be completed by the end of the first week of April. <br>The authorities together with the national associations of General Practitioners and Specialists are working on an agreement, which will allow the GPs, the office-based Specialists, as well as the municipal health care organisations, to provide additional care to patients upon an ‘early’ discharge from hospitals. The ‘early’ discharge means that, whenever possible, patients are going to be discharged earlier than normally to free up hospital capacity, if extreme pressure on the capacity should occur.	Children and grandchildren are not permitted to visit elderly homes and all activities have been cancelled up until June 1<br>The Ministry of Health and Danish Health Authority have been running an intensive public informational campaign (tv and radio spots, posters, social media, dedicated official websites) educating people about the disease, its symptoms, the rationale and the rules for self-quarantine, or how to self-handle or seek help in case of anxiety and mental distress. The campaign is continuously expanding, covering now materials dedicated to specific population groups, such as elderly, pregnant women, families with new-borns, or those experiencing symptoms. The materials are available in a number of languages. As of end of March, the Facebook of the Danish Health Authority had nearly 12 million views (in a country of around 5 million people). 	
Estonia	EST				58.777	25.977		On 25 March, the government decided that it will provide the EHIF with at least EUR 200 million to cover the extraordinary costs of coronavirus. The extra money will cover the extraordinary expenses of hospitals, ambulances and general practitioners from the beginning of March to the end of May. The largest part (EUR 150 million) of the extraordinary costs in the health system will be used to fund hospitals and specialist care over the next three months, primarily linked to the provision of intensive care. This includes both additional staff costs and medical expenses. In addition, over EUR 20 million was earmarked for the purchase of personal protective equipment, respirators and coronavirus testing capabilities.	PHC and outpatient specialist care providers have increased consultations via telephone, email or alternative digital channels and Estonian Health Insurance Fund have introduced online-consultations as a new service. Also, sick leave notices are possible to open at PHC digitally.<br>The EHIF introduced a fee for distance outpatient specialist consultations as of 16 March to provide an alternative for usual office visits. The health care provider has to inform the patient in advance whether the remote channel will be phone, video call or text messages. The EHIF advised all service providers to use remote appointments as of 24 March to replace physical outpatient admission. 		Medical care for all people who have an acute illness is considered emergency care, and is funded by the EHIF for both insured and uninsured people. Testing for COVID-19 is free of charge for all patients if they have a referral from a family doctor. On 13 March, one private clinic initiated testing at EUR 81 per test for those people not fulfilling the free of charge testing criteria. This initiative was suspended on 16 March due to unexpectedly high demand, as well as the country-wide revision of testing criteria which requires mobilization of all public and private testing capacities. Usual out-of-pocket payments still apply (e.g. patients pay for the transport, unless they are taken to hospital by ambulance; treatment is free of charge for insured people, and emergency care is free of charge for everyone; there is fixed inpatient fee up to EUR 2.50 per day, which excludes intensive care).		There are 239 ventilators in intensive care units in hospitals. 50 ventilators are in reserve and can expand intensive care capacity. An additional 75 ventilators have been ordered. On 25 March, the government decided to order 150 more ventilators. Once the ordered ventilators are delivered, Estonia will have just over 500 ventilators for its 1,3 million population.<br>There are no large PPE manufacturers in Estonia, but the government has requested companies to reorganize their standard work to help with the lack of PPEs and disinfectants, if at all possible. The Government Office signed an agreement with an Estonian company in Sillamäe that guarantees the state 50,000 FFP3 type mask per week for half a year starting in mid-April. The company is preparing to double production to produce up to 100,000 masks per week for the state. The value of the half-year contract is up to 10 million euros.  The first shipment of centrally procured PPEs from China arrived in Estonia on the 2nd of April. The order was placed by the North-Estonian Regional Hospital and the Ministry of Social Affairs, though the central procurement process is the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. A second shipment of centrally procured PPEs arrived in Estonia on 7 April. With this delivery, 740,000 surgical masks, 350,000 FFP2 protective masks and 12,100 protective coats arrived in Estonia.  Exports of certain pharmaceuticals (e.g Roactemra and Pulmozyme) have stopped in order to protect stocks for the anticipated increase in ICU patients. Starting from 4 April, the Minister of Social Affairs changed the conditions and procedures for the wholesale of medicines by creating additional obligations during the emergency. Wholesalers who maintain at least a 10% share in the pharmaceutical market must submit their stock information to theAgency of Medicines at the end of every working day. The Agency of Medicines compiles a summary report based on the submitted information within the next working day. This enables Estonia to keep track of its pharmaceutical stock. 	The Family Physicians Association, together with the Health Board, has set up guidelines for all family doctors about how to protect the medical personnel by changing the way services are delivered.   The hospitals have to create a plan about how to sustain their capability to provide services during the crisis, and submit the plan for approval by the Health Board.  Mid-March, the providers started preparing their staff and equipment for the necessary changes in the crisis situation. For example, the hospitals are providing financial incentives to healthcare workers, while hospital staff with high risk are encouraged to work in areas that have no direct contact with patients.  An NGO has set up a database of inactive health workers who might be willing to voluntarily contribute in the case of need. 	Drive-in testing points have been set up in 8 regional centres, and are open from 8am to 9pm. Mobile teams pick up samples at home for people not able to drive to the testing point.<br>On 2 April, the Defence Forces field hospital will start working at Kuressaare Hospital, in the island municipality of Saaremaa, in order to support the hospital when needed. The field hospital is normally intended for use in military conflict and is equipped with ventilators and generators. The field hospital can activate a mobile treatment unit with surgery, emergency medicine, intensive care and general ward capabilities. When the field hospital is set up, it will create up to 20 intensive care beds, with an additional capacity of 40 general ward beds in tents.

Expected to be matched with EUR 90M by the pharmaceutical industry. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has activated its plan for managing emerging health threats, which determines how EMA responds to and communicates on serious public health threats. It provides scientific advice and clinical trial guidance to developers of new vaccines and treatments, scientific advice; and accelerated assessment and conditional marketing authorisation procedures. EMA and the European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCePP) facilitate collaboration among researchers through encouraging all researchers to register  pharmacoepidemiological studies related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the EU PAS Register and to upload and make public study protocols, with a description of the data collected or planned to be collected.										
Finland	FIN				62.716	26.192			Finland’s strategy focuses on testing, tracing, isolating and treating. The progress of the disease can be impeded through extensive testing, effective contact tracing of identified infections and chains of transmission, isolating those whose are ill and quarantining those who have been exposed. As part of this strategy, the Government is continuing with preparations to introduce a mobile application for use in managing the epidemic. A precondition is that the application must be voluntary and must ensure privacy protection.<br>The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) is inviting Finnish citizens, based on random sampling, to participate in a study assessing the spread of the new coronavirus in the population. The study will cover all age groups and will be implemented in cooperation with university hospitals. The main purpose of the current study is to gather up-to-date data on how large a proportion of the population has formed antibodies to monitor the extent to which the epidemic has spread in different age groups and regions and how long the antibodies remain in the body. This information will support decision-making when assessing what measures are needed at each stage of the epidemic.  		Services for COVID-19 patients are provided with standard co-payments or fee waivers depending on the individual financial status. Ordinary regulations also apply on sickness allowances. With regard to special measures due to pandemic, persons who have been ordered to stay away from work, in isolation or quarantine, get infectious disease allowance to compensate for earning losses upon physician’s certification. Carers for children under 16 years of age in quarantine are also entitled to the allowance. People who are recommended (vs mandated) to self-isolate or stay away from work are not entitled  to infectious disease allowance		On 20 March, the government announced about EUR 39 million of extra spending on health care to cover expenses related to the coronavirus. The government also plans additional funding to cover local governments' spending. A series of emergency measures was adopted to safeguard medicines and medical supplies. The sale of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals used in the public health-care system is restricted and municipalities are no longer obliged to provide timely non-emergency care (until 13 May).<br>The government restricted the sale of medicines, goods and services used in healthcare services. The aim was to ensure the availability of medicinal products and essential medical supplies as well as the functioning of the distribution chain in Finland in the exceptional conditions caused by the coronavirus.	On 19 March, the government announced that requirements for emergency/first aid staff can be relaxed in order to ease their recruitment for work. The Helsinki-Uusimaa Hospital district has started training existing surgical and ward staff in treating COVID-19 patients, including intensive care. Similar efforts have also been taken by other hospital districts. There have also been discussions on recruiting medical students to do contact tracing as the test capacity increases.   On 25 March, the Government issued a decree to implement the obligation of healthcare professionals to carry out work set out in the Emergency Powers Act. The aim is to ensure sufficient supply of health workers to avoid shortages during the coronavirus epidemic. The decree will be in force from 26 March 2020 to 13 April 2020. In line with the decree, people working in both public and private healthcare who have received training in the field and are between 18 and 68 years of age may be required to work.                                                                                On 23 March, the government decided that emergency conditions justify taking into use the medical supplies and protective equipment stored in the state emergency stockpiling. The aim is to ensure that there is enough protection for healthcare and social welfare professionals throughout the country if the epidemic expands. Protective equipment is mainly reserved for healthcare personnel caring for patients with confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as face masks and shields. <br>MSAH (Ministry of Social Affairs and Health) decided that emergency conditions justify taking into use the medical supplies and protective equipment stored in the state emergency stockpiling . The aim is to ensure that there is enough protection for healthcare and social welfare professionals throughout the country if the epidemic expands. Protective equipment primarily means personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare personnel caring for patients with confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as face masks and shields, respiratory protective devices, surgical masks, medical gowns, etc.	The number of ICU beds has been estimated at 300 and the number of intensive surveillance beds is about 150-200. After the declaration of the Emergency Powers Act on March 17th, the government instructed all emergency care services to streamline their activities and hospitals to increase their capacity.  Capacity increase has been done by converting operation theatres and recovery areas into intensive care units. Authorities have estimated that the capacity can be doubled if needed. The Helsinki University Central Hospital dedicated one of its buildings to COVID-19 patients. According to the hospital’s CEO, there are currently 280 ventilators in Helsinki and Uusimaa area. According to government, the total number of ventilators in Finland is about 1000.<br>The number of ICU beds has been estimated at 300 and the number of intensive surveillance beds is about 150-200.

Revised criteria are following: 1. One of the following symptoms such as short of breath, sever fatigue, or high fever, 2. fever or coughing among elderly people or those with existing medical problems, 3. common cold like symptpms for more than four days. Previously criteria was more restrictive such as four days of fever above 37.5 degrees. <br>Throughout the country, diagnostic tests were given to those who contacted designated call centres directly or through their doctor and meet certain criteria such as fever above 37.5 degrees, a strong sense of fatigue or a respiration problem. Since 02/03/2020, tests can be given to those whose doctor considers medically necessary. However, tests are considered not widely available. RT-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and subsequent treatment are fully funded by the central government. COVID-19 is categorised as a designated disease from 01/02/2020 and therefore the legislation applied  is  different  from  those  applies  to  other  diseases  (covered  by  health  insurance). On 02/03/2020, tests  were  included in the health insurance coverage without any cost-sharing component, to increase testing. However, RT-PCR tests are not funded for people who do not meet symptomatic criteria. 	Hotline for DV victims has started through SNS on 20th April.  It will be available in 10 languages from 1st May. <br>Hotlines for DV victims have been set up at the central and also regional levels (e.g. Kanagawa, Tokushima) and information to support victims is made available on the website of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW).

For instance, Osaka prefecture has started collecting money for a fund on 22 April and announced to provide the allowance of between JPY 100000 and 200000 (USD 950 and 1900) to health care professionals as it has collected JPY 1 billion (USD 95 million) by 6 May. <br>MHLW requested health care providers to provide training particularly in the area of intensive care and the use of ECMO. MHLW has also requested nurses who are not currently practicing to return to work. 	Osaka prefecture designated two of their hospitals to care only for Covid-19 patients. One of the hospitals is specialised to care for Covid-19 patients with medium level symptoms and it started providing care on 1st May. The other hospital will provide care for Covid-19 patients who are elderly with milder symptoms.<br>On 15 April, the Japan Medical Association started sending JMAT (Japan Medical Association Team) as “COVID-19 JMAT” to take care of Covid-19 patients who have mild symptoms as the request of regional medical associations. JMAT is teamed up voluntarily with doctors, nurses, and other co-medical professionals originally for preparing a disaster in Japan. JMAT had already sent to support the medical care of the Covid patients in the cruise ship from 14 Feb 2020. 	MHLW announced the key points to prevent the spread of infection in nursing care facilities based on the "Revised infection control manual for elderly care facilities" issused in 2019".<br>MHLW issued the first information notice on how to deal with SARS-CoV-2 infection to long-term care (LTC) and other social welfare institutions, child care facilities and schools on 18/02/2020. Since then, a number of information notices were issued. For example, the notice issued on 25/02/2020 included self health assessment to be undertaken by health care professionals and infection prevension measures to be implemented for visitors such as families of hospitalised patients, and suppliers and subcontractors for health care providers. Following these, hospitals and long-term care facilities limit visitors to protect the sick and elderly who stay there. As usual, hand disinfectant is available for visitors to hospitals and long-term care facilities. Masks are secured for staff working at health and long-term care facilities by banning reselling  of  masks and providing a subsidy to companies to produce more masks. At least several hospitals have started to conduct PCR tests to all patients prior to hospitalisation to avoid risks of healthcare-acquired infection. At least several LTC services have temporarily stopped their services to avoid the spread of infection.

COFEPRIS is accelerating permits for imports and exports of equipments and techonologies donated or purchased for the COVID19 response (e.g. the ones ones recently brought from China); it is also securing its quality, for instance, through CENAPRECE for ventilators and InDRE for diagnostic tests.	Military medical workers and facilities will be part of the response to the pandemic. The national Health Emergency Agreeement (Acuerdo de Emergencia Sanitaria) was published on March 30th, including the role of different government Secretaries to assure the good organisation and availability of human resources. The Institute of Health for Wellbeing (INSABI) opened a call to increase the number of health workers (Doctors of Wellbeing); by April 7, 6,548 doctors and 12,605 nurses have signed up. Online training about COVID19 has been set up for health workers across the country.	The Federal Government has signed an agreement with the National Association of Private Hospitals and the Mexican Consortium of Hospitals, who will make available 50% of their beds in order to free up spce in the public sector to take care around 12,500 patients; the prices paid by the government will be the same as the ones paid to other public institutes (e.g. IMSS, ISSSTE).	Elderly workers and workers with chronic diseases or compromised immune systems are allowed to work remotely with pay during the pandemic crisis. The government has put in place online information and a telephone dedicated for the elderly. As part of the National Time of Health Distance (Jornada Nacional de Sana Distancia), from March 30 onwards, people 60+ years old, pregnant women and people with chronic diseases must remain in their home. 	
Netherlands	NLD				52.426	5.721			In a press conference, the Ministry of Health announced that the governement is planning to introduce two apps for smartphones. One of the apps would be used to track who someone infected with coronavirus has directly contacted. The second app would be used by someone to monitor their own symptoms. The exact nature of the app and under which conditions it will be used, in terms of voluntary or mandatory, data storage, use for data mining, reversbility, etc. are also unclear. This has raised many concerns among the public, scientists, ethiscists and policiticians. 60 scientists and other experts addressed a public letter to the responsible ministers in which they call on them to carefully take into consideration how the use of such an app can have a social impact, may threaten fundamental civil rights, leads to stigmatizing and the effectiveness of this app.   				There are impending shortages in protective equipment, especially face masks. The guidelines for mask use were adjusted on 9 and 18 March. FFP2 masks are now only used when treatment may cause a lot of aerosols (as is the case with intubation and some other medical procedures). In all other cases, surgical masks are considered sufficient .  Hospitals should keep used masks in order to disinfect and reuse them as soon as an approved method becomes available<br>The number of validated test-labs is increased from 15 to 41. These include biovetenary labs, the diagnostic lab from the bloodbank and hospital labs. Total test capacity will increase from  4000 tests per day to 17 500 tests per day.		National  association for intensive care called on hopspitals to upscale IC beds from 1100 to a maximum: 2400 beds. This is still too low in the most likely scenario according to the National institute of Public Health/ national association of nurses says has stated that caring for patients in 2400 beds will be unfeasible given the lack of medical staff. <br>A national coordination center was created at Erasmus Medical Center. This centre distributes corona patients over Dutch hospitals and monitors available beds with a real-time computer system. 	All nursery homes or small-scale facilities for the eldery are closed for visitors at least untill 28 April 2020. Exceptions can be made for people in palliative stage. 	
New Zealand	NZL				-42.558	172.377		NZD 500 million was allocated to the health sector	Government advice states if you need to see a doctor or other medical professional an individual must phone first. Most consultations will happen over the phone, or by videoconference, to stop any risk of the disease spreading by person to person contact.

Three free online tools are now available: • the Mentemia app developed by All Blacks legend Sir John Kirwan • a health journal app called Melon • an e-therapy programme called Staying on Track. Last week the Government launched two additional mental health support programmes  - Getting Through Together and Sparklers at Home – a set of wellbeing activities and resources for parents to use with children at home.	To ensure people do not stockpile medicines, doctors are advised not to provide prescriptions for longer than one month. <br>From 22 April 2020, only approved point of care test kits for COVID-19 will be able to be imported and sold in New Zealand. Tthe importation and sale of all point of care COVID-19 test kits are banned, unless they gain approval. No point of care test for COVID-19 has so far been approved.   This announcement does not affect the test kits currently being used by the Ministry of Health for COVID-19 testing.	The Govt. is encouraging healthcare workers who are retired to return to the workforce, as well as healthcare workers who now have availability due to suspension of non-essential services. <br>Medical interns working in New Zealand have had their scope of work extended to include ‘COVID-19 related health services outside of accredited clinical attachments’ up until November 2020. 	Private hospitals are taking on urgent elective surgeries from the public sector (e.g. cancer surgery). Private hospitals have also cancelled their own elective surgeries.   	Alert level 4 is associated with a range of change to aged care facilities including:  no family visits; termination of non-essential services in aged care; and no audits of facilities <br>Ministry of Health Guidance issued on PPE for community care providers including aged residential care, aged-related community care, disability, hospice, and homecare

Peru	PER				-12.664	-72.98			On March 27, the MoH authorised the use of telemedicine for different purposes, coinciding with the needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.		Peru has defined that all diagnostic test and treatment due to COVID-19 will be free for all their inhabitants, in part, due to the open affiliation in the Integral Health Insurance (SIS) for currently uninsured people. 	Health workers of the Community Centres for Mental Health have maintained access for patients using teleconsultations and in-person crisis interventions when needed during the quarantine time.	The government assured 1 million 400 thousands rapid tests for COVID-19. Also, the MoH has distributed thousands of basic personal protective equipment and specialised equipment for ICU unit workers. Laboratory capacity (PCR for COVID-19) has been decentralised to regions other than Lima, with the support of the National Health Institute that has received extra resources from the government (around €660 000). By May 5, the Peruvian government affirms having the capacity of conducting 20 000 tests per day.	On April 4, a transfer of PEN 720 (around $215) to workers in the medical sector supporting the emergency was announced.	The MoH defined that the Hospital Ate in Lima will be used exclusively for COVID-19 patients, having 50 ICU beds and 150 regular beds. The newly inaugurated Hospital of Vitarte in the Lima region will be also a reference centre for COVID-19 patients, having 50 ICU beds available. In the Callao region, the Naval Hospital has been defined as the reference hospital, totalising 276 ICU beds in the country by March 27. Nine mobile hospitals have been implemented, 4 in Lima and 5 in other regions, along with campaign centres in 12 other cities for triage and taking of samples. The Minstry of Housing has installed 100 new modules in hospitals to increase the spaces destined for COVID-19 related tasks. The team "Te cuido Perú", coordinated by the Ministry of Defense, was created to oversee and assure that quarantines are respected across the country. The government authorised the provision of care between patients affiliated to different health insurance institutions. 	Vaccination against influenza and neumococo has been provided as a home-service for the elderly.	
Poland	POL				52.442	19.72		On 8 March, the authorities unlocked 23.3 million EUR (98 million PLN) for hospitals. On 19 March, the Government has announced additional 7,5 billion PLN package for hospitals in the framework of Covid19 Measures (Tarcza Antykryzysowa)	The government has released an app called "Home Quarantine" that allows people to confirm the place where they are, basic health assessment and direct reporting of danger. It also makes it easier to supply the most-needed items to people who cannot do this themselves.<br>Legislation has been passed to extend and ease the use of phone consultations and implement broader use of video consultations. Now, within designated health care organisations, physicians of all specialties and some nurses can perform remote phone and video consultations, which are recognised as a face-to-face consultations in the reimbursement systems. 	Section on digital: https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus/kwarantanna-domowa				Legislation has been passed to facilitate ease of engaging by hospitals retired health workers as well as ease of reassigning helath workers to non-standard tasks and creating non-standard work schdules.

Portugal	PRT				40.957	-7.799	RESEARCH 4 COVID19: 1.5 million Euros have been allocated by the National Agency for Research (Fundaçao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia) to fund R&D projects that contribute to improving the response of health systems to the impact of COVID-19, contributing to better patient management and / or the implementation of public health measures, in line with the provisions of the National Plan of Preparation and Response to Disease due to new coronavirus (COVID-19). The intention is to stimulate collaborative national R&D networks, as well as the retargeting of activity in the R&D units supported by FCT towards R&D initiatives that respond to the needs of the National Health Service (SNS). This new support from FCT is, therefore, mainly to complement ongoing initiatives and to support the reorientation of existing teams. Instituto Ricardo Jorge is sequencing 1000 genome type of SARS-CoV-2 which will allow studying their genetic mutation, transmission of the virus in the population, severity of covid19 as well as effectiveness of treatment and vaccines under development. There is also an open source R&D initiative between academia, philantropic organisations and start-ups for the development of ventilators: https://www.science4covid19.pt/ventilador-open-source/	Two new laws dated from 13 and 24 March 2020 change health financing governance of the Portuguese NHS, allowing some health expenditure related to centralised procurement procedures to be authorised automatically or with few legislative procedures as it was imposed since TROIKA.<br>The two biggest Portuguese private health insurances adopted radically different coverage decisions in regards to treatments related to COVID-19 provided by the private sector and not prescribed by the public NHS: while Multicare (Fidelidade) ensures coverage for treating patients with COVID-19 in the private hospitals, Medis (Ageas) suspended full coverage of these argumenting that this is responsability of the public NHS. \	Telemedicine is being used for triaging patients. National guidelines for triage and referral of COVID-19 patients have been enforced: emergency and phoneline calls are the main entry point, with patients asked not to visit health providers directly; persons with mild symptoms are generally advised to stay at home until symptom free for 48 hours; and those with severe symptoms are referred to testing in a hospital setting. Telemedicine is being used to substitute external consultations in loco. These started being done over the phone or via telehealth to avoid contact. Also the National Foundation for Science (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia) is launching with the health authorities another initiative to mobilize the national scientific and technological community to combat the pandemic caused by the coronavirus in a context of open data for research and innovation, which integrate, namely, metadata, datasets or hyperlinks, problems report, research results in epidemiological surveillance and other secondary public health and anonymized data necessary to combat the coronavirus epidemic, such as clinical, analytical and demographic results.

A free NHS phoneline 7x24 for psychological support with 63 menatl health specialists (psychologists) has been created in partnerhsip with Ministry of Health (Serviços Partilhados do Ministério da Saúde), the phylantropic foundation Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian (donating 300M Euros) and the charter of psychologists Ordem dos Psicólogos Portugueses.	On May 3, Portugal has capacity to complete more than 15,000 tests a day, equating to more than 35,000 tests per million inhabitants. This testing strategy is supported by a wide network of more than 60 state, university and private labs that have worked together to test as many people as possible, prioritising on health workers and nursing home residents. By this date, the country has tested around 350,000 people.<br>Increased diagnostic testing capacity using military lab professionals and alternative testing protocols were allowed. As in many other countries, there have been shortages in protective equipment (e.g. masks, personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer), with mobilisation of the Portuguese society contributing to alleviate this (for instance using 3D printers and productive textile capacity). A low number of ventilators is recognised as critical weaknesses in the Portuguese NHS. Therefore, the Ministry of Health has acquired 1500 new ventilators, 154 of them have already been received (https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/economia/coronavirus/detalhe/portugal-recebe-amanha-144-ventiladores).	Measures to re-organize health care personnel were put in place before the situation became critical. The government requested all personnel with ties to the NHS to only work in the NHS, and given the low number of nurses, a special hiring program was implemented. GPs have been trained to carry out distinct activities. Other measures ave contemplated in the current contratual arrangements  involve: suspension of overtime limits and annual leduring the period of emergency state; simplification of contratual arrangements for hiring health care workers; Emergency childcare facilities were reorganized to allow critical workers to stay at work, and home care professionals were given support. A low number of anaesthesiologists, together with a low number of ICU beds and ventilators are recognised as critical weaknesses in the Portuguese NHS.	Increase hospital capacity. Elective surgeries were postponed if considered as non-urgent. Whenever possible patients were discharged to free beds and staff, and to reduce the risk of infection. External consultations were postponed or started being done over the phone or via telehealth to avoid contact. These measures allowed NHS hospitals to free up capacity to deal with COVID-19 related services. The hospital network was reorganized so that some hospitals were put at the forefront for COVID-19 patients and one hospital will be fully dedicated to the treatment of COVID-19 patients from the second week of April onwards. By early April (April 6) there is still enough hospital capacity, although the pressure is increasing with slightly over 1,000 COVID-19 patients being admitted. So far ICU capacity is sufficient for critical patients, with the stock of ventilators being increased and more being arriving from China. NHS is extending capacity by contracting out with the private sector. The private sector has been supporting the NHS for non-elective care when adequate, field hospitals have been erected in some strategic locations, and primary care services have been adapted to the new context.	All external vists have been suspended to nursing homes, long term care facilities including aged care and disability population groups. Individuals in end-of-life care may be granted special permissions to be visited.	
Slovakia	SVK				48.757	18.957			The only incentive that was put in effect was a bonus payment for telehealth services (including an expansion of a scope of services that can be done through telehealth tools). 				Since 26 March, capacity of testing rapidly increased to approximately 1000 tests per day. The capacity reached 2000 in April and is expected to grow up to 3000 per day.   Samples are collected at the special tents (external testings points) at the hospital entrance (altogether 78 hospitals in Slovakia), as of 21 April, 55 testing points were functional.   Since 1 April, 4 laboratories are performing the analysis of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 within the Slovak Republic (based in Bratislava, Košice, Banská Bystrica and Trenčín).  In total, nine crews of emergency ambulances have been designated for collection of biological materials for testing in the Slovak Republic. Each region has one designated crew that can provide the collection of biological material (mucosal swabs) from patients at home who are suspected to have COVID-19.  <br>Based on Institute for Health Policies, the Slovak Republic will be able to handle approx. 600 ventilated patients with COVID-19 without limitations. The government decided to procure 400 extra ventilators and prepare sufficient HR capacities. 				
Slovenia	SVN				46.037	14.534	On 20 April 2020 the Institute of Microbiology, together with the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia and the University of Primorska started a project, where 3000 persons were selected across 300 statistical units to represent the population of Slovenia. They will receive an invitation, and if they accept it, they will be swabbed for COVID-19 and a blood sample will be taken for antibodies. The principal investigator, Prof Mirko Petrovec, head of the Institute of Microbiology hopes for at least a 50% response rate. The persons included would be retested in 6 months and if in the meantime they showed symptoms of COVID-19 they would be fast-tracked for diagnostics. This should give an insight about the total prevalence of infection in the population since various models and hypotheses envisaged numbers between 3000 and 10000.						A very important challenge in the health as well as social sector is the lack of protective equipment ranging from full FFP3 masks to other parts of personal protective equipment (PPE). Also, in this respect, the Government took very rapid action and secured through various channels, including rapid purchases, rapid tenders and donations at least a 10 to 14-day supply of PPE. 	To increase or maintain the availability of health workers, the Government decided to interrupt all specialty training programmes and appoint doctors in specialist training to services, which are needed to manage the COVID-19 epidemic. Additionally, medical students have been commissioned to work on a special free helpline (under the supervision of experienced specialists, mostly infectious disease specialists, epidemiologists and public health doctors). If needed, there might be a call for nursing professionals who had previously worked in ICUs to return to the workforce in order to help bridge the workforce gaps there.  Special bonuses are envisaged from the budget for those health professionals who work in especially high-risk environments and are actively involved in the management of the epidemic and the care of patients. The Act provides bonuses up to 100% of the basic salary based on the actual time spent on high-risk activities and services in the delivery of care. 	Ljubljana launched the first mobile hospital in front of the military base Edvard Peperk, which will be able to host up to 120 patients.<br>The main concern regarding physical infrastructure was providing enough capacity to keep COVID-19 patients in separate wards and to provide adequate capacity for therapy with oxygen and in ICUs, including ventilators.  The latter was of particular concern as Slovenia at the end of February 2020 was unlikely to secure more than 120 beds for such patients and not all of them would be fitted with adequate ventilators. Hence, the Government decided to push through rapid tendering procedures to purchase ventilators, which led to the commissioning of at least 300 additional ventilators. In the meantime, additional staff, especially nursing staff, will be trained for work in ICUs.

The app will be based on the open-source concept DP-3T ("Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing") developed by a group of researchers from various European universities.				The federal government introduced an obligation for cantons to report inventories of essential medicines and medical goods, including ventilators, diagnostic tests, surgical masks or protective suits. The goal is to identify supply bottlenecks early and remedy them in a targeted manner. The federal government also procures goods that cannot be bought through usual channels. The material is then allocated centrally health care providers of cantons, non-profit organisations and third parties (e.g. laboratories, pharmacies). Certain medicines may  be used to treat Covid-19 patients without regulatory approval, provided that the medicine contains an active ingredient specified in the relevant federal regulation and that an application for approval has been submitted to the national regulatory agency (Swissmedic). These measures were approved by the federal parliament in various sessions since mid-March 2020.	Cantonal governments are given the right to require hospitals, clinics and physician offices to provide patient care for essential procedures; they are not allowed to provide non-urgent care.  Some cantons, for instance Zurich, have introduced pools of health care professionals. People can be dispatched from these pools to support care in hospitals facing the highest demand.   Until June 2020, the army mobilised 8000 persons to support verious public services with personnel. This includes 3000 persons for to support health care services, dircet patient care care, patient monitoring, medical transportation and hospital logistics. Many cantons have also mobilised civil defence volunteers.	Based on a decision by the Federal Council on 16 April, from 27 April, hospitals and outpatient medical practices will be able to resume all medical procedures, including non-urgent procedures.	The southern Canton of Ticino introduced stricter rules to for older and vulnerable people than for the general population. Cantons have the right to introduce these restrictions if they health care capacity limits are reached. Elderly and vulnerable people are explicitly prohibited from going shopping and, in some cases, are only allowed to go to the doctor or work. They are required to get help from relatives or use the municipal services for home delivery.

The Prime Minister announced GBP 210M for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) on 26 March 2020.	The Health Secretary announced over 13 billion pounds of NHS debt will be written off, which includes the historical debt of 100 hopsitals. The changes hope to provide financial support during the viral pandemic. <br>HM Treasury is creating an emergency response fund, set aside to ensure the NHS and other public services have the resources they need to tackle the impacts of COVID-19. Initially set at £5 billion, it will fund pressures in the NHS, support local authorities to manage pressures on social care and support vulnerable people, and help deal with pressures on other public services. The size of the fund will be reviewed as the situation develops, to ensure all necessary resources are made available. 	The NHS is promoting the use of telephone and videoconsulations for primary care. This includes directing all general practices to have the capacity to carry out video consultations between patients and clinicians.  A rapid national procurement effort took place to support the general practices that currently do not have an online consultation solution.  As such, digital healthcare appointments have surged during the coronavirus outbreak. For example, digital health care provider Livi — which provides remote consultations to the NHS and across Europe through an app — has recorded a 107 per cent increase in consultations from 1 February to 13 March compared with the six weeks before. Consultations with people who have “viral symptoms” were up 240 per cent, while new registrations also increased by 64 per cent. Chatbots are being used to identify patients with COVID-19, though there is little evidence to support their effectiveness. Teleconsultations and digital first itnteractions with General Practices being promoted. An app is being used to help recruit around a quarter of a million volunteers for the NHS during the coronavirus outbreak.<br>The NHS COVID-19 App automates the process of contact tracing. Its goal is to reduce the transmission of the virus by alerting people who may have been exposed to the infection so they can take action. So far, the UK has launched the first phase of the integrated contact tracing and testing programme on the Isle of Wight. This programme will play a central role in how the UK manages the rate of COVID-19 transmission alongside restrictions on social distancing.

The Duke and Dutchess of Cambridge are supporting the Every Mind Matters platform, which includes a 'Mind Plan' tool. Guidance is being issued to mental health providers. <br>All of the NHS’s 1.4 million staff will be offered free mental health support from Friday to help them cope with the “shell shock” of tackling Covid-19.  NHS staff will be given free access to a programme of more than 1,500 specialists, online therapy and group counselling sessions. They will also receive practical and financial assistance as well as specialist bereavement, psychological support and help with sleep problems.	A National procurement programme for assisted respiratory support capacity, particularly mechanical ventilation, is  well under way in the UK. This includes working with the manufacturing sector to begin production of mechanical ventilation equipment. <br>The UK prepared a national stockpile of PPE, in preparations for an outbreak of pandemic influenza or a no-deal Brexit. This stockpile has been released, with the Armed forces brought in to deliver the equipment across the country. To help mobilise this national supply of PPE, the UK has established a National Supply Distribution Response (NSDR) system, to support and coordinate the delivery of emergency PPE. Moreover, a new dedicated unit has been set up to focus on securing additional supplies of PPE, constituting of expert procurement professionals, to identify PPE suppliers from across the globe. 	To mobilise the health workforce, the NHS put out a call for volunteers and former doctors and nurses to return to support the health system during the crisis. This includes retired doctors who are given the opportunity to re-register. Medical and nursing students towards the end of training can opt-in for early registration. <br>NHS Volunteer Responders is a new group that will carry out simple, non-medical tasks to support people in England who have been asked to shield themselves from coronavirus because of underlying health conditions. They will be used by healthcare professionals to make sure people who are highly vulnerable to coronavirus are able to stay safe and well at home. So far the group has received 750,000 applications. 	New temporary hospitals are being built in seven major cities to provide additional intensive care unit capacity. The London Nightingale hospital became operational on the 3rd of April, with capacity to treat 4,000 patients, with 500 beds equipped with ventilators and oxygen. The capacity will then continue to increase, potentially up to several thousand beds, should it be required.<br>The NHS has set out new hospital discharge criteria. Based on these criteria, acute and community hospitals must discharge all patients as soon as they are clinically safe to do so. This is expected to free up 150,000 beds.Other steps taken includes block-buying capacity in independent hospitals, and post-pone all non-urgent elective surgeries. 	The UK has released guidance to care homes to strongly recommend against allowing visiting. Care home providers are also encouraged to report capacity for bed vacancies to support system resilience, and increase the use of skype and virtual conference calls for interactions with GPs, acute care staff and local public health teams.
